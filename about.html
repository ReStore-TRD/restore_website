            <h3>ReStore</h3>
            <p>
                At the end of each semester, outgoing students discard tonnes of usable 
                goods when they graduate/return home from exchange (since everything must 
                be removed from their residences when they move out). Every January and 
                September, new students arrive and must buy new housewares- the same types 
                that were thrown away only months before. This mismatch in timing between 
                supply and demand perpetuates a cycle of waste. We have set up ReStore to 
                bridge this gap and facilitate the reuse of goods by storing donated goods 
                for incoming students.
                
                Starting May 2019, ReStore was set up in Moholt and accepted its first 
                donations from outgoing students. These items are sorted, stored, and will 
                be distributed to incoming students in August.
                
                Besides the immediate and tangible result of waste reduction, a parallel 
                goal of this project is to change how students think about the items they use, 
                and question when it is necessary to purchase new. This challenges both the 
                notion of products as consumables and the idea that a product lifespan ends 
                when one is finished with it; ReStore encourages students to think of themselves 
                as stewards of goods rather than consumers.

            <h3>ReSykkel</h3>
            <p>Every autumn, the used bicycle market becomes a cutthroat competition between new students to find a bike (any bike!). At the end of their study period, many students find it difficult to sell their bicycles, especially in December. We want to bridge this mismatch between supply and demand by storing bicycles for students over the holidays and selling them on departing students’ behalf. This accomplishes three main things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>New students can find a reliable ride</li>
                <li>Students can get a fair price for their bike when they sell it</li>
                <li>Fewer bicycles become abandoned.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Many students, out of desperation to find a bike end up with unsafe rides. 
            Our mission is to provide a place where students know both that they can 
            buy a bicycle and their money is directly supporting another student. 
            This will lower the number of bicycles students abandon because they 
            just don’t know what to do with an unsold bicycle. We will also fix 
            up previously abandoned bicycles, returning them to circulation and 
            increasing the availability of bikes to students in Trondheim.
            If you’d like to help set up this initiative, get in touch at resykkel@restore-trd.no.
