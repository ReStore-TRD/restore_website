                        <p>We're just a bunch of people who don't like seeing good stuff go to waste.</p>
                        <h2>This seems really cool, how can I get involved?</h2>
                        <p>Send us a message on FB or email info@restore-trd.no! We’re always happy to 
                            have more volunteers. We especially need volunteers in December/January and May/June.

                        <h2>How is that even possible?</h2>
                        <p>All these goods were donated by past students to help you out. 
                            We ask that you pay it forward by bringing the items back when 
                            you're done with them :)
                        </p>
                        <p>We are also lucky to have generous support from the Velferdstinget 
                            and Sit Bolig (including the facilities and van).
                        </p>
                        <h2>You’re called NTNU ReStore- is this only open for NTNU students?</h2>
                        <p>All students in Trondheim are welcome, whether you’re from NTNU, BI, 
                            HiST, or DMMH. PhD students, you’re students too!

                        <h2>I need this table, but it has a bunch of stuff on it. Can I move the stuff and take the table?</h2>
                        <p>Talk to our volunteers (in the super-fly ReStore gear) and we'll figure something out with you.</p>

                        <h2>What sort of things do you take?</h2>
                        <p>We'll take your household goods (big and small) that you think a student 
                            would be happy to have! Hangers, laundry racks, kitchen equipment, and desk 
                            lamps are especially popular items.
                        </p>
                        <h2>When can I drop off my stuff?</h2>
                        <p>Check <a href="#">our Facebook page</a>  for updated information. Due to COVID, we have changed 
                            how we receive donations at ReStore. Now you can drop off at anytime, contact 
                            free, on the back porch of the kindergarten. Simply take a photo of your donation 
                            when you drop it off and send us in a message with date and time. Our volunteers 
                            will bring it inside after 72 hours.

                        <h2>Can I donate my bed/mattress?</h2>
                        <p>Unfortunately not. Due to bedbug concerns we are unable to accept beds, 
                            mattresses, bed linens, or bed pillows.
